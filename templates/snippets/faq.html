	<p>
         John Hagel III's and John Seely Brown's initial conception of a pull platform comes from 
         a <a href="http://www.cluteinstitute.com/ojs/index.php/JSS/article/view/4305">2008 article</a> they later 
         expanded in their 2010 book, <em>The Power of Pull</em>. The fundamental idea of a pull platform, is that
         instead of extensive predication and planning, the resources and services in the pull platform are 
         directly "pulled" from the needs of users and active participants. For the Catalog Pull Platform
          staff, librarians, library administration, commercial entities, and algorithms are these sources of pull.

	<p> 
          Linked Data is about making relationships between our data more explicit in machine-readable formats. 
          A Linked Data statement, called a RDF Triple, is usually in the format of <em>subject predicate object</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we think of as "bibliographic records" are, in a linked-data context, is just a collection of statements 
          that follow this basic RDF triple model. Any subject, predicate, or object can be a string, an URI, or a 
          blank node. A collection of these triples makes up a RDF graph.

	<p class="font1 pad_bot1"><strong>Do you have a shameless book plug?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, Jeremy Nelson and Chandos Publishing are in post-production on a book,
          <a href="http://becomingleanlibrary.com"><em>Becoming a Lean Library: Lessons from the World of Start-ups</em></a> 
           that goes into much 
           more detail on the Catalog Pull Platform, Build-Measure-Learn loops, and other 
           lean manufacturing and lean start-up ideas and concepts as applied to libraries and other 
           cultural heritage organizations.
